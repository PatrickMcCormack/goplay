This is a simple set of thread-safe go collections (a work in progress)
  1. Stack
  2. Queue
  3. Binary Tree
  4. Heap

It's interesting to see how many language features are in the binary tree code which is a relatively small amount of code:
- user defined types
- type inference
- type assertion
- structs
- composition
- struct literal initialization of explicit elements
- pointers
- locking (read/write locks)
- deferred statement execution
- empty interfaces
- methods
- package visibility
- go testing framework
- anonymous functions
- closures
- go docs, try "go doc" or "go doc ClosureBasedNonRecursivePreOrder"
